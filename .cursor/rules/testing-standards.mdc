# Testing Standards

## Test Framework

- ONLY use pytest or pytest plugins
- Do NOT use the unittest module
- All tests should be in `./tests` directory

## Type Annotations

- All tests should have typing annotations
- All tests should be fully annotated and contain docstrings

## Required Imports

When using TYPE_CHECKING, import the following:

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from _pytest.capture import CaptureFixture
    from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest
    from _pytest.logging import LogCaptureFixture
    from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch
    from pytest_mock.plugin import MockerFixture
```

## Test Organization

- Create all necessary files and folders
- Create `__init__.py` files in test directories
- Run tests with `pytest tests/`
